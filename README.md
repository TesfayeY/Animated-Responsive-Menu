# Animated-Responsive-Menu

The provided code is a responsive navigation bar implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a menu containing links for Home, About, Blog, and Contact, organized within an unordered list (ul) inside a navigation (nav) element. An eye-catching circular icon, positioned on the right side of the navigation bar, triggers a special functionality.

In the CSS section, styles define the appearance of the navigation elements, including link formatting, hover effects, and a smooth transition animation. Initially hidden, the navigation menu remains concealed with zero width and opacity. However, upon clicking the icon, JavaScript toggles classes to reveal the menu with a sliding animation from the right side. Media queries adapt the navigation's layout for smaller screens, adjusting font sizes, link padding, and overall styling to optimize the navigation bar's usability on mobile devices. The JavaScript event listener tied to the icon enables a toggle effect, changing the icon's appearance and displaying or hiding the navigation menu, thereby enhancing user experience across various devices. This code snippet encapsulates a responsive navigation bar with a hidden menu, revealing itself upon user interaction with the icon, catering to both desktop and mobile browsing scenarios.
